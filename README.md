# A-Tale-of-Deep-Symmetry-in-the-World
A Tale of Deep Symmetry: A geometric model of matter-antimatter symmetry using simple physical analogs. Explores CPT symmetry through cardboard tubes (energy), colored corks (charge), and plastic lids (spacetime polarization), proposing a mechanism for gravity-induced matter conversion and cosmological asymmetry.
